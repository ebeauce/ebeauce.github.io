Bio
---

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (`LDEO <https://lamont.columbia.edu/>`_), Columbia University, New York.

I am a geophysicist: I use data and theory to understand Earth's mechanisms. My current approach to studying the shallowest part of Earth is statistical seismology, that is, the study of statistical properties of ensembles of earthquakes. Such properties give insights into fault mechanisms (e.g. seismic vs aseismic slip, localized vs distributed slip) and volcanic processes (e.g. magma migration). My research uses a variety of skills from earthquake seismology, signal processing, complex systems, data mining. An essential part of my job is also dedicated to the design and application of high performance computing tools in order to analyze large volumes of data within reasonable times.
