I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory ( LDEO ), Columbia University, New York. My work focuses on observing the collective behavior of earthquakes to better understand faults and fault structures. A large part of this work is dedicated to developing the methods necessary for identifying the many small earthquakes in our study regions, namely automated earthquake detection and location methods. As seismology is now entering the realm of data science, because of the large volumes of data that are available, I also explore the possibilities offered by machine learning algorithms and see if we can do better than traditional techniques.
