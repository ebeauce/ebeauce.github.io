# Welcome !

I am a graduate student of the Geophysics Program in the Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences ([EAPS](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/)) department at MIT.

My work, supervised by [Michel Campillo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZCRP01AAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao), focuses on the development of methods for automatic earthquake detection. I am particularly interested in studying how the large amount of seismic data can be processed with modern techniques emerging from machine learning.
